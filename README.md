# 🧠 Quantum HR Workforce Optimizer (PEO Demo)

A **fully working**, interactive demo you can publish from GitHub and share on LinkedIn.

This app shows how **quantum-inspired optimization** can help a PEO (e.g., TriNet-style model) explore many workforce futures at once — balancing:

- 💰 Cost
- 🛡️ Compliance / Risk
- ❤️ Retention

> ⚠️ This uses **synthetic data** only. It’s for education + thought leadership.

## 🎥 LinkedIn Live Script (30-sec starter)

“HR is not a spreadsheet problem — it’s a complexity problem.  
Watch this: I’m going to change growth, cost, and compliance risk… and the optimizer will jump to a new ‘best workforce future’ in seconds.”

Then ask chat: **‘Should we optimize for cost, risk, or retention?’**
